# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to expand the existing vocabulary dataset for the flashcard application to include 200 words per CEFR level (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2), totaling 1,200 vocabulary words. The current dataset has approximately 392 words with uneven distribution across levels. We need to add new vocabulary words while ensuring no duplicates and maintaining consistent data structure and quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want access to 200 vocabulary words at each CEFR level so that I can study appropriate vocabulary for my proficiency level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the vocabulary dataset is complete THEN each CEFR level (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) SHALL contain exactly 200 unique words
2. WHEN adding new vocabulary words THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate words across all levels
3. WHEN a word exists in the current dataset THEN it SHALL NOT be added again even if it belongs to a different level
4. WHEN counting words per level THEN the system SHALL accurately categorize words by their assigned level property

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all vocabulary entries to follow a consistent data structure so that the application can process them reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new vocabulary words THEN each word SHALL include all required properties: id, word, pos, thai, definition, examples, hint, level, cats
2. WHEN creating word IDs THEN each new word SHALL have a unique sequential ID starting from the next available number
3. WHEN defining word categories THEN each word SHALL have at least one category from the existing category set
4. WHEN providing examples THEN each word SHALL have at least one example with both English and Thai translations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want vocabulary words that are appropriate for each CEFR level so that I can progress systematically through difficulty levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN words are assigned to A1 level THEN they SHALL be basic, high-frequency words used in everyday situations
2. WHEN words are assigned to A2 level THEN they SHALL be common words for familiar topics and routine tasks
3. WHEN words are assigned to B1 level THEN they SHALL be intermediate words for work, school, and leisure contexts
4. WHEN words are assigned to B2 level THEN they SHALL be upper-intermediate words for complex topics and abstract concepts
5. WHEN words are assigned to C1 level THEN they SHALL be advanced words for sophisticated expression and nuanced meaning
6. WHEN words are assigned to C2 level THEN they SHALL be proficiency-level words for academic and professional contexts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Thai language learner, I want accurate Thai translations and contextual examples so that I can understand how to use each word correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing Thai translations THEN they SHALL be accurate and commonly used equivalents
2. WHEN creating example sentences THEN they SHALL demonstrate practical usage of the word
3. WHEN translating examples THEN the Thai translations SHALL be natural and contextually appropriate
4. WHEN providing hints THEN they SHALL help learners remember or understand the word meaning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the vocabulary expansion to maintain existing categories and introduce new ones as needed so that the categorization system remains coherent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing categories THEN new words SHALL use categories already present in the dataset
2. WHEN introducing new categories THEN they SHALL be relevant and useful for vocabulary organization
3. WHEN categorizing words THEN each word SHALL belong to logical and appropriate categories
4. WHEN reviewing categories THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency in category naming and usage
